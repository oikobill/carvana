My plan:

1. Make a new directory called small_dataset that has the following organization

small_dataset
    train <-- Contains 256 by 256 resized images
    train_masks <-- contains the resized masks

2. Make baseline submission using the average mask. This will help with setting up the infrastructure for the competition.

--------- DONE ABOVE HERE ---------

3. If I want to improve my current submission by a bit, you can average by angle

4. Prototype the U-net implementation
